# myReactProject

## A description of the various Tasks involved in creation of this App.

This project was initiated using a blank template from React Native with Expo CLI. The following adjustments were made to the "App.js" file:

Here is a paraphrased version of the changes made:

- Modified the "View" component to have a different golden (yellow) background color.
- Updated the "Text" component to show "My name is Augustine Ninyung".
- Set the font size of the text to 24.
- Made my name "Augustine Ninyung" appear in bold within the text.
